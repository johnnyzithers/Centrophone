#Centrophone

Centrophone is a centroid-ordered sample player. The librosa library is used to 
analyze the centroid of a random selection of audio samples. The samples are 
mapped to the keyboard in order of the spectral centroid ordering. The instrument 
is written in Csound, and implemented using the python Csnd6 module.
